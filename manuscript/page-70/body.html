<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">apartment of white marble, the walls of which were inlaid with gold in the strange hieroglyphics of the First Born.</p><p>From the high dome of this mighty apartment a huge circular column extended to the floor, and as I watched I saw that it slowly revolved.</p><p>I had reached the base of the Temple of the Sun!</p><p>Somewhere above me lay Dejah Thoris, and with her were Phaidor, daughter of Matai Shang, and Thuvia of Ptarth. But how to reach them, now that I had found the only vulnerable spot in their mighty prison, was still a baffling riddle.</p><p>Slowly I circled the great shaft, looking for a means of ingress. Part way around I found a tiny radium flash torch, and as I examined it in mild curiosity as to its presence there in this almost inaccessible and unknown spot, I came suddenly upon the insignia of the house of Thurid jewel-inset in its metal case.</p></div> </div>
